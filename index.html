      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML provides structure and outline to a webpage.</li>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>The script element has an opening and closing tag. You can embed JavaScript code
          inbetween the opening and closing script tags</li>
        <li>You link to external JavaScript files with the src attribute in the opening script tag</li>
        <li>By default, scripts are loaded and executed as soon as the HTML parser encounters them </li>
        <li>The defer attribute ensures that the entire HTML file has been parsed before the script is executed</li>
        <li>The async attribute will allow the HTML parser to continue parsing as the script is being downloaded, but
          will execute immediately after it has been downloaded.</li>
        <li>The old convention was to put scripts right before the body tag to prevent the script from blocking the rest
          of the HTML content. Now, the convention is to put the script tag in the head element and to use the defer and
          async attributes.</li>
